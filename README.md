**Background**

Introducing "Chain Of Control", an interactive visualizer that takes you on a journey through the inner workings of one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world. From sourcing raw ingredients to delivering finished products to customers, this visualizer gives you a bird's eye view of how PepsiCo maintains a steady flow of goods and services.

This interactive visualizer is designed to be user-friendly, informative, and fun. It's for anyone who wants to learn more about how PepsiCo. operate, from students and researchers to business professionals and investors. With "Chain of Control", you'll have all the information you need to understand the inner workings of these powerful companies at your fingertips.

**Functionality & MVPs**
In "Chain Of Control", users will be able to:

- The visualizer will use small circles to represent the parent node (Pepsi) and its child nodes (subsidiaries and facilities).

- When a user clicks on a certain node, they will be able to see a small description of what goes on at that point in the PepsiCo's supply chain.

- The visualizer will provide a comprehensive overview of PepsiCo's supply chain, from the top (raw materials sourcing) to the bottom (product delivery to customers)

- The visualizer will display information about each node such as location, facility type, and products manufactured in that facility.

In addition, this project will include:

- An About modal describing the background of the visualizer 
- A production README
